To run the web application locally (NOTE: Steps 3 & 4 only needed to access the social media extraction feature):

1. Clone the codebase entirely
2. Import the necessary modules
3. Follow the directions on this page (https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/get-started) to register for a Twitter developer account and access the API.
4. Generate tokens and keys after creating your personal app on the Twitter account. Replace the entries in 'twitter_credentials.json' with your own tokens and keys.
5. Run app.py, and a localhost server link will be displayed in the console.
6. Click on that hyperlink to run the web app.
